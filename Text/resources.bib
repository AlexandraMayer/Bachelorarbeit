 abstract = {Current work on delay management in railway networks has -- to the best of our knowledge -- largely ignored the impact of passengers' behavior on train delays. This paper describes ongoing work aiming to explore this topic. We propose a hybrid agent-based architecture combining a macroscopic railway network simulation with a microscopic simulation of passengers in stations based on the LightJason agent platform. Using an initial instantiation of the architecture, we model a simple platform changing scenario and explore how departure delays of trains are influenced by delays of incoming trains, and by numbers and heterogeneity of passengers. Our results support the hypothesis that passengers' behavior in fact has a significant effect on delays of departing trains, i.e., that passengers' behavior in stations must not be neglected. We recommend to include these effects in up-to-date models of delay management.},

@article{Seriani.2015,
 abstract = {The objective of this work is to determine, by means of simulation and experiments, the effect of pedestrian traffic management in the boarding and alighting time of passengers at metro stations. Studies were made by means of a pedestrian traffic microsimulator (LEGION Studio) and experiments at the Human Dynamic Laboratory (HDL) of Universidad de los Andes in Santiago de Chile, to obtain criteria for the pedestrian traffic management on the platform and doors of metro cars. The methodology consists of building a boarding/alighting hall of a metro car and the relevant portion of the platform in front of the hall. The simulation scenarios included the location of the vertical handrail in the hall of the car, delimitation of a keep out zone in front of the doors and the use of differentiated doors for boarding and alighting. The results of the simulation and laboratory experiments are expressed in Pedestrian Level of Service (LOS), Passenger Service Time (PST), passenger density on the vehicle and platform, and passenger dissatisfaction. Both, the simulation results and laboratory experiments allow us to give some recommendations for the pedestrian traffic management in metro systems.},

 abstract = {Mass transit rail stations make up complex systems in which passenger flows have significant influence on operations and traffic conditions. Are there pedestrian simulators that can effectively contribute to the management of crowd flows? To answer this question, an assessment grid is built to address scientific principles as well as operational and organizational needs. The scientific principles encompass real-world features to be described, especially causalities to reproduce. The grid is applied to several commercially-available software (including PTVVisWalk, Legion, Anylogic, MassMotion and SimWalk) as well as to research-sourced pedestrian simulators.},

@article{Davidich.2013,
 abstract = {The value of a pedestrian stream simulation depends on its ability to reproduce natural behaviour of pedestrians in different situations. Most models assume that pedestrians are single-minded and constantly move towards their destinations. However, our observations at two major German railway stations made during field experiments and our analysis of video recordings at one of these stations revealed that in virtually every setting a significant proportion of pedestrians do not walk continuously. Instead, they occasionally change their route in order to visit certain locations and stand there for a period of time. By waiting, they often block walking pedestrians and thereby influence the overall dynamics. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of waiting pedestrians and propose a model for waiting pedestrians based on cellular automata. The model is able to reproduce the observed pedestrian behaviour. We illustrate the model with simulations of several real life scenarios for a major German railway station and show that during rush hour standing pedestrians may prolong walking time by up to nearly 20{\%}. We also demonstrate how the developed model can be used for the analysis of infrastructures, and prediction of problematic areas in public spaces.},

@article{Chen.2017,
 abstract = {Multiple components such as complicated station environment, heterogeneous pedestrians and diverse interactions make it difficult to realize an effective pedestrian simulation in subway stations. A multiagent-based model is proposed on the basis of the metamodel proposed by B{\'e}h{\'e}, which includes the subway station environment abstraction model, three-level pedestrian agent model and interactive rule base. The first term incorporates some notions to satisfy the specific modeling demands of subway stations and uses the object-oriented modeling method to realize a normative, extensible and flexible simulation environment building platform. The second integrates the three levels of NOMAD model and takes staged pedestrian behaviors into account, which works well for simulating real pedestrian behaviors in subway stations. The third realizes various and staged interactions correctly and automatically. Finally, a case study of Ping'anli Station in Beijing Subway is presented and three comparison issues are introduced to validate the effectiveness of our models.},

@article{Carreon.2017,
 abstract = {The equal headway instability-the fact that a configuration with regular time intervals between vehicles tends to be volatile-is a common regulation problem in public transportation systems. An unsatisfactory regulation results in low efficiency and possible collapses of the service. Computational simulations have shown that self-organizing methods can regulate the headway adaptively beyond the theoretical optimum. In this work, we develop a computer simulation for metro systems fed with real data from the Mexico City Metro to test the current regulatory method with a novel self-organizing approach. The current model considers overall system's data such as minimum and maximum waiting times at stations, while the self-organizing method regulates the headway in a decentralized manner using local information such as the passenger's inflow and the positions of neighboring trains. The simulation shows that the self-organizing method improves the performance over the current one as it adapts to environmental changes at the timescale they occur. The correlation between the simulation of the current model and empirical observations carried out in the Mexico City Metro provides a base to calculate the expected performance of the self-organizing method in case it is implemented in the real system. We also performed a pilot study at the Balderas station to regulate the alighting and boarding of passengers through guide signs on platforms. The analysis of empirical data shows a delay reduction of the waiting time of trains at stations. Finally, we provide recommendations to improve public transportation systems.},

@article{Zhang.2008,
 abstract = {This paper presents a cellular automata-based alighting and boarding micro-simulation model for passengers in Beijing metro stations. According to observations of passenger alighting and boarding behavior and an analysis of field data collected in three metro stations in Beijing, components of alighting and boarding time and the effects of different group sizes on the alighting and boarding performances are studied. Based on this analysis and investigation, items including individual desire, pressure from passengers behind, personal activity and tendencies (dependent on gender, age, etc.) are put forth as important factors that influence passenger behavior in certain external conditions. The transition probability defined by these factors is used to model passenger cooperation and negotiation at a microscopic level, while collective performance is used at the macroscopic level for the model validation. For model verification, simulation experiments that include a wide range of alighting and boarding group sizes and ratios were run. The results show that the behavior that arises from the model captures the fundamental traits of alighting and boarding movement. The model is helpful in the evaluation of functionality of facilities and passenger organizing in metro stations.},
